Thanks gentlemen, that is one of my checks with Finance so I will be sure to confirm that the drive/shares are available to the escalade servers!

Gerg, I will be performing the changes Saturday afternoon/evening, will you be available around 5-7 pm to test for functionality?

The drives on Gremlin going offline is the only problem we’ve had recently that I can think of.

If you need someone to test over the weekend, I can help with that.

Thanks,

Hey Cristian,

One item I would include when the team completes the escalade remediations, is verifying that the path \\gremlin\gpshare is available to the servers. I believe one of the items that sometimes seems to occur is the LUN being down, and checking on the drives particularly \\gremlin\gpshare would help from an infrastructure perspective.

Hey Greg is there something else you can think of that could help from an infrastructure standpoint after work has been done on the servers?

Hi Clyde and Nadia,

We will be doing PCI remediation on the Escalade servers this weekend and will be in need a validator SME to confirm that great plains is up when done. 

Usually, I do the preliminary test when patching to confirm GP can be accessed, but I believe we will need more of an intensive test. 

1.	Is this Saturday 01/19/19 Ok with working on the Escalade servers (front-end servers only, no SQLs)?
2.	Can we have someone from finance log in and test GP Saturday evening/Sunday morning? 
 
Thanks in advance
