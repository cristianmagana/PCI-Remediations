Thank you Nicole and everyone involved for helping to find common ground. 

I will be making myself available if any issues tomorrow morning please call my cell and I will quickly see to getting things operational. TLS 1.0 server will be remain enabled and other protocol/ciphers remediation will take place.

Subject: RE: IT 450282 - DSM TLS/Ciphers

Cristian and I have discussed this. The plan is to move forward with updating the cyphers tonight on all of the servers and leave TLS 1.0 enabled. This will avoid the known issue we have with TLS upgrade while letting the cypher changes proceed. To date we have not had any issues with those changes. We(DBAs) will check the servers in the morning to make sure they are still working as expected.

We will need to come up with a plan to upgrade these servers which will allow us to upgrade to TLS 1.2.

Thank you,

That number counted “SQLNCLI10” which I am seeing that after some of the latest patches won’t work. But it does also include 181 connections that are using “OLEDB”.

Also keep in mind that the DEV servers are the main playground for many users. So if this goes in is someone going to be available at 7:00am CT to roll things back?

Can you change just one server and let us do some testing before rolling this out in mass?

Before we put this on hold for 7+ months can we confirm that these all use an OLEDB connection? 

Also I would like to have security and management on the same page as to why we are not attempting to remediate in a development environment???

The worst case scenario is that we remediate and then I turn TLS 1.0 back on in the morning. The script takes care of 5-8 other vulnerabilities tied to weak ciphers, leaving 1 (TLS 1.0) unremediated.  

I ask that we take try to take care of what we can now and fix it in the am if it happens to break before we halt this for 7+ months. We can discuss this with the different stakeholders if necessary.

This change looks like it will break more than 1700 connection strings for us. (These are just the out the outdated connections.) This will impact several teams and bring their ability work to a halt. 

ServerName      PackageConnections
SadArchiver1                     21
TMGDevCuetsWH           20
TMGDevIVRSQL1             23
TMGDevRptsSQL             19
TMGDevRptsWeb            17
TMGDevWareHouse      1694


Why don’t we go down the road of getting an exception for this for the time being. I say that because we have to migrate everything off the out main warehouse server by July and will be able to address the vast majority at that time. This will give the BI team a chance to change their items as well, which are not being represented in this list.

Subject: RE: IT 450282 - DSM TLS/Ciphers

We have not tried to update TLS on these boxes so we do not know definitively if it will break. 

In order to not upgrade we have to show why this cannot be done now, and what our plan is to remediate this moving forward. One thing I can offer is if the DBA team can show that these servers use the OLEDB driver I can add it to my exception list of servers that need to have the OS updated in order to use the newer version of OLEDB that supports TLS 1.2. 

My aim of updating all servers in the lower environments to inventory what systems cannot support TLS 1.2 now, and create a path for remediation in the coming months. 

Last thing to note is if the SQLs do not get the update other servers that these communicate will drop the connection since they won’t be on the same protocol. Best case scenario is remediate, discover, and document. I have looped in security to weigh in as needed.

Cristian - Please do not do upgrade the servers below. If we know this is an issue then it doesn’t make sense to roll it out and then roll it back. The reason being if you upgrade these servers you will stop all development in its tracks.

TMGDevRptsSQL
TMGDevIVRSQL1
SADSQLBIRpts1
TMGDevWarehouse

Jay – SADSQLSSAS2 is in the list to be upgraded. I’ll leave it up to you whether this one gets upgraded or not.

Can you try to initiate a connection and share the error that you are getting (also timestamp so I can check the logs)?

Cristian – Please hold off on these changes for the DBA related servers. We are still having issues connecting to servers using SSIS from our desktops that have the TLS changes rolled out to them. We really cannot move forward until a solution is found as we need to be able to access these servers for development and support.
