Hi Nadia,
 
Would like to check the availability to remediate the escalade servers this weekend? I also have Windows patching for Saturday night for Finance servers. I would like to take care of both in one fell swoop.  Thanks,

Yes; I’ll tentatively reschedule it for 01/26/19 barring testers availability. 
 
Thanks for the heads up.
