John,
 
eCom’s MemberPay web server has an underlying issue that needs to be remediated asap. We have submitted a expedited ticket to consolidate the vmdk this Saturday evening during the maintenance window. 
 
Could you provide a SME to validate once the disks have been consolidated? We will need to bring the server down for a period of time, possibly for 2 hours.
