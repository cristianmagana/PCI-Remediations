HI
My assumption is that you are talking about both Beat and Production applications?
If so, I have tested and did not encounter any issues with Springboard and MCI in beta and production. I have also tested OS in Beta and did not encounter any issue.
Please let me know if you need more information. 

Thank you

William

Can we get confirmation that the Application Dev boxes are operational? This should all be fine with the remediation made, they were simple fixes.

Hi Cristian,

Can you please specify what hours William would need to be available to test. 

@William – please confirm which items you are comfortable covering.  If need be we can try to pull in additional testers.

Thank you,

Vicki

I am not aware of any issues at the moment. I’ve connected to several of these and have not had any issues. Just a reminder that SABWEBCT1 is not a DBA server, so I cannot speak to that one.

Cristian – I am the on call resource and would be responsible for this, however these are beta serves so they don’t have to be done during that change window. Also, since these are beta servers you can do them at night and I check them the next morning. That’s the typical cadence we follow for dev and beta.

SABWEBCT1 is not a DBA server, this is an application server for ClearTrend so realistically belongs to the BI team.

Thank you,
