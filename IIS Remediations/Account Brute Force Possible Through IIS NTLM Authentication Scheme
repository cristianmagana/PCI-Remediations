Solution for: Account Brute Force Possible Through IIS NTLM Authentication Scheme CVE-2002-0419
Please help to resolve the vulnerability:-Account Brute Force Possible Through IIS NTLM Authentication Scheme CVE-2002-0419
How to resolve this in Win 2003/2008?
Although I have got workaround:- disable NTLM authentication for your Web server. This can be done by unchecking "Integrated Windows Authentication" within "Authentication Method" under "Directory Security" in "Default Web Site Properties".
Is this fine for my webservers[win 2k3/2k8], will it require any Reboot/IIS Restart?
Is there any other better way to resolve this?
